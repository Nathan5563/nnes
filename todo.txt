Crucial (immediate next steps)
- Fix PPU
    - Why zelda messed up?
    - Why no SMB?
    - Why top-left pixel buggy?
    - Why code ugly? refactor
    - Learn sprites properly
- Implement APU

Important (do in parallel or in the near future)
- Make egui debugger containing cpu/ppu/apu states
- Implement unofficial opcodes
- Implement more mappers

Nice to have (perfect emulator accuracy)
- Implement reset interrupt instead of initialization function
